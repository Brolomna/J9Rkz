                            <p>Hi there! I’m Anmol Siwa, though you might know me online as <strong>Just9n55</strong>. I’m from Nepal, where I work as an ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher.</p><br>

                            <p>Teaching is more than just a job for me—it’s about making learning enjoyable and meaningful for my students.</p><br>

                            <p>When I’m not in the classroom, you’ll probably find me exploring my passions—technology, creativity, and self-improvement.</p><br>

                            <p>I’ve always been fascinated by cybersecurity and love tinkering with smartphones, tweaking Android setups to make them more efficient (and fun!). There’s something satisfying about making tech work just the way you want it to.</p><br>

                            <p>I’m also a lifelong learner. Whether it’s memory techniques (like the memory palace or linking method), Morse code, or picking up new languages (I speak English, Nepali, Hindi, and some Chinese), I enjoy challenging my brain in different ways.</p><br>

                            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is speedcubing—I use the <strong>ROUX method</strong>, and my best time is under 40 seconds (still working on improving!). My cube collection keeps growing, and I love the mental workout they provide.</p><br>

                            <p>Magic tricks, especially card magic, are another little joy of mine. There’s something special about bringing a moment of wonder to someone’s day.</p><br>

                            <p>Music has been a constant companion in my life—I sing and play a few instruments, including the guitar, keyboard, drums, and some traditional Nepali instruments. To me, music is a universal language that connects people.</p><br>

                            <p>And yes, I’m a gamer too! From PUBG and Minecraft to Among Us and Apex Legends Mobile, I love diving into different worlds. I’m also part of <strong>GUFFLIKE Esports</strong>, where we help organize tournaments and scrims to support Nepal’s growing esports community.</p><br>

                            <p>At the end of the day, I’m just someone who loves learning, creating, and sharing what I discover along the way.</p><br>
