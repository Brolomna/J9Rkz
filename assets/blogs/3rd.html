					<p><strong>Oh, so you want to learn hacking, huh? Well, I'm glad you're interested! To truly dive into the world of hacking, you need to know Linux. Why? Because Linux is the go-to operating system for cybersecurity enthusiasts and ethical hackers.</strong></p>
					
					<h2><br>Let‚Äôs Talk About Linux</h2>

					<h3><br><strong>What is Linux?</strong></h3>
					<p>
					  Linux is an Operating System (OS) that helps us interact with the computer. The most commonly used OS is Windows by Microsoft. Why? Because it‚Äôs user-friendly and easy to learn. It‚Äôs probably the one you‚Äôre using right now if you‚Äôre on a computer or laptop.
					</p>
					<p><br>
					  So, what‚Äôs Linux, and why are we talking about it? Because if you‚Äôre interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking, like I am, you need to know Linux.
					</p>
					<p>
					  Sure, people have different preferences, but knowing Linux is crucial. Why? Most tools used in the cybersecurity world are better supported on Linux than on Windows. Plus, with the right knowledge, you can tweak a lot of things at the system level to suit your needs.
					</p>
					<p><br>
					  <strong>Linux gives us control and flexibility for cybersecurity tasks, right?</strong> Exactly! There‚Äôs more to it, but that‚Äôs enough for a basic understanding of Linux for now.
					<br></p>

					<h3><br><strong>How Do I Start Using Linux?</strong></h3>
					<p><br>
					  Do I have to wipe my PC‚Äôs data to install Linux? 
					  <br>
					  Well, yes‚Äîif you want to completely switch to Linux. But there are better ways to try it out without sending your entire setup to the graveyard. üòÜ
					</p>
					<p><br>Here are a few ways to use Linux without affecting your Windows system:</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>1. Using Virtual Machines</li>
					  <li>2. Dual-booting</li>
					  <li>3. Live-booting with secondary storage (like a USB)</li>
					  <li>4. Learning on platforms like Hack The Box Academy & TryHackMe</li>
					</ol>
					<p><br>
					  You can find tutorials for these methods with a quick search. I use the Live-boot method with a bootable USB (pen drive), which works great for me.
					<br></p>

					<hr>

					<h3><br><strong>What‚Äôs a Bootable USB?</strong></h3>
					<p>
					  A bootable USB is just like a normal USB, but its functionality has been changed. Normally, we use USB drives to store and transfer files. But a bootable USB works like a CD you‚Äôd use to install Windows. It allows you to boot your computer into Linux directly from the USB. Here‚Äôs how it works:
					</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>1. Turn off your computer.</li>
					  <li>2. Plug in the bootable USB.</li>
					  <li>3. Turn on the computer.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><br>
					  There‚Äôs a little setup involved after restarting. You‚Äôll need to press a specific key to access the boot menu (it varies by computer) and then select the USB to boot into Linux.
					<br></p>

					<h3><br>Ready to Give Linux a Try?</h3>
					<p>
					  That‚Äôs how you boot into Linux without erasing your current system. Got it? If not, read it again. üòÇ
